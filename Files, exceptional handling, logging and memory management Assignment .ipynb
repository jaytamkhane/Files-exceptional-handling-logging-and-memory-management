    "2) What is exception handling in Python ?\n",
    ">  Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that helps manage and respond to errors or exceptions that occur during the execution of a program. Exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program, such as attempting to divide by zero, accessing a nonexistent file, or using an undefined variable.Python provides a structured way to handle such errors, allowing the program to recover gracefully or perform specific actions when an error occurs. This prevents the program from crashing unexpectedly."

This method allows developers to define cleanup actions for the object before it is deallocated by Python's garbage collector."
